InDesign plugin to ignore missing plugins information from documents

Opening an InDesign document saved with plugins which are no longer available causes many annoying problems like
1. Have to Save As each time you save the file, providing a location and name for the save
2. Not able to package the document, once you edit it as it requires the missing plugins

Solving this requires a cumbersome process of exporting the original indesign into IDML and then resaving it back to INDD format.

All these issues are effectively solved by InExUtils plugin, using this plugin you can easily ignore all the missing plugin information present in the document. All the open documents are changed at one go. This saves time and helps you to concentrate on your major work of designing rather than taking care of issues like IDML and INDD.
